		<h1>Golden State Warriors Rookie Backgrounds</h1>
		<h2>Season: 2021-2022</h2>
		<p><span>J</span>onathan Kuminga (7th pick) - 18 year-old straight out of the new G-League Ignite squad, he is an extremely raw talent with elite physical tools and an incredibly high ceiling.</p>
		<p><span>M</span>oses Moody (14th pick) - After a year of playing for the University of Arkansas, this 3&amp;D wing is going to be an immediate contributor for the team.</p>

		<h3>Potential Starting Lineup:</h3>
		<p>Stephen Curry (Point Guard) - MVP finalist in the previous season with a league-leading 32.0 ppg at a blistering 65.5 TS%. He continues to be the center of the Warriors offensive scheme. Keep a lookout on him for potential MVP next season.</p>
		<p>Damion Lee (Shooting Guard) - This position is completely up for grabs by any of the Warriors players, be it Moody, Poole, or even Mulder, Damion Lee appears to be the most likely starter as he is one of the best and most consistent shooters on the team. He is an unselfish role player who knows the Warriors system, and can provide solid contribution in the minutes given to him.</p>
		<p>Andrew Wiggins (Small Forward) - He continues to be an iron man for the Warriors, missing just one game last season. He is the Warriors' best wing defender, and with the return of Klay Thompson, his shooting splits will be even more efficient than ever.</p>
		<p>Draymond Green (Power Forward) - Draymond's name is nearly synonymous with Stephen Curry's. The two of them have what is possible the tightest synergy between a player duo in the entire league. The anchor of the Warriors' defense, Draymond is a pivotal piece in the Warriors roster.</p>
		<p>Kevon Looney (Center) - Although it feels like forever since Kevon joined the Warriors, and despite him sometimes looking like he is way older than he is both physically and on the court, Kevon is only 25, and he knows the Warriors' system inside and out. He is an intelligent player who just knows how to play winning basketball.</p>
